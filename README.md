# Textarea Preview for ProcessWire

Adds a preview and zoom button to regular text areas for live preview.

While you type in the text area, the changes are sent to the server via ajax and processed by all text formatters that are assgined to that field.

Useful to see live how the content will turn out, especially for markdown or textile.

The default style sheet contains Github-like styles but the style sheet is configurable, see module settings.
